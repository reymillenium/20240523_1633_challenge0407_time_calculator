# COP 1334 Assignment - Introduction to C++

## Chapter 4: Challenge 7

## Title: Time Calculator

### Exercise Description:

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of seconds.

- There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 60, the program should display the number of minutes in that many seconds.
- There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 3,600, the program should display the number of hours in that many seconds.
- There are 86,400 seconds in a day. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 86,400, the program should display the number of days in that many seconds.

## Execution from the Terminal (Alternative way without an IDE):

We must provide to the Compiler the same switches that we usually do in the IDE:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp
```

That will create a file named 'a.out' if you are working in MacOS or a .exe file if you are on Windows. That's the default executable file's name when we don't provide a name.

But we can also specify the name of the resulting executable file:

```terminal
g++ -Wall -std=c++17 main.cpp -o your_prefered_executable_file_name
```

And in order to run that a.out file, we must execute on the terminal:

```terminal
 % ./a.out
```

## Result of Execution on the Terminal (MacOS example):

```terminal
reinier@reinier % ./your_prefered_executable_file_name
Enter a number of seconds: 0
You must enter a number greater than zero. Try again please.
Enter a number of seconds: 234523452345
Those 234,523,452,345 seconds are equivalent to: 2,714,391 days, 19 hours, 25 minutes, and 45 seconds.

Process finished with exit code 0
reinier@reinier % 
```
